"Three people are walking outdoors. The person on the left is wearing a dark blue jacket, while the one in the middle has blonde hair and is dressed in black with a plaid shirt underneath; they both have their hands in their pockets as they walk forward together from behind another man who appears to be speaking or singing loudly into something outside the frame at an angle facing right front. This last individual wears a gray knitted hat over his head along with a thick coat that reveals part of a blue patterned inner layer beneath it\u2014this person also sports a beard. As time progresses after these three individuals pass by each other sideways without any interaction between them during this process, there seems to be some movement among those around him due to camera shake rather than actual action within the scene itself."
