"The video begins with a group of people walking outdoors, surrounded by trees with bare branches, suggesting it might be autumn or winter. The individuals are dressed in casual attire suitable for cooler weather, including jackets and hats. As the video progresses, the focus shifts to a person wearing a beanie and a blue plaid shirt, who appears to be looking off to the side, possibly observing something or someone out of frame. The background remains consistent with the previous scene, featuring the same leafless trees and a clear sky, indicating that the setting is likely a park or a similar open area. Throughout the video, there is no significant camera movement; it maintains a steady shot, capturing the group and the individual in a continuous, unaltered view."
